# Citi-Bike-Analytics-Project

### ABOUT THE PROJECT

The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of data gathered in 2018 from the New York City Bike Sharing program, known as Citi Bike, which stands as the largest bike sharing initiative in the United States.

Starting in 2013, the Citi Bike Program has established a robust infrastructure dedicated to the systematic collection of data related to program utilization. Thanks to the diligent efforts of the team involved, bike data is meticulously gathered each month, meticulously organized, and subsequently made accessible to the public on the dedicated Citi Bike Data webpage: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

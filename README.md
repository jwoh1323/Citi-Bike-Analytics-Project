# Citi Bike Analytics Project

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of data gathered in 2018 from the New York City Bike Sharing program, known as Citi Bike, which stands as the largest bike sharing initiative in the United States.

Starting in 2013, the Citi Bike Program has established a robust infrastructure dedicated to the systematic collection of data related to program utilization. Thanks to the diligent efforts of the team involved, bike data is meticulously gathered each month, meticulously organized, and subsequently made accessible to the public

## ETL process

To streamline the ETL process in this analysis, I implemented urllib for the automated download of numerous Excel files (refer to [this link](https://github.com/jwoh1323/Citi-Bike-Analytics-Project/blob/a43f046b56c8bd6b4bb12e1dbac44501882f0683/app.py) for a detailed overview). Following the download, Python was employed to unzip the files (please refer to [this link](https://github.com/jwoh1323/Citi-Bike-Analytics-Project/blob/a43f046b56c8bd6b4bb12e1dbac44501882f0683/unzip_files.ipynb)) , and the data integration was achieved through Pandas by merging the individual files into a cohesive dataset (please refer to [this link](https://github.com/jwoh1323/Citi-Bike-Analytics-Project/blob/a43f046b56c8bd6b4bb12e1dbac44501882f0683/merge_rawdata.ipynb)).
